NAME
    Git::XS - Perl XS binding to libgit2

SYNOPSIS
        use Git::XS;

        my $git = Git::XS->new(
            repo => "path/to/git/repo",
        );

        $git->init;
    
        print $git->status;

        $git->add('file.name');

        $git->commit(-m => 'It works');

        $git->fetch;

        $git->push('--all');

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a Perl binding to libgit2. It attempts to make a clean OO
    API for dealing with git repositories from Perl. It should be very fast.

STATUS
    WARNING: This module is still in the "proof of concept" phase. Come back
    later.

    So far new() and init() are working. Kind of.

    Find me online if you have good ideas for this module.

INSTALLATION
    You can install this module like any other CPAN module, but you will
    need 2 programs in your PATH:

        git - to clone the libgit2 repository from GitHub
        cmake - to build libgit2

    In the future, this module might use your system's copy of libgit2.
